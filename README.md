This repository mainly contains the code of hands-on session which I conducted during workshops and lectures for the graduate and post graduate students. 
The hands-on sessions are beneficial for those who want to start the journey of Machine Learning and are interested in knowing the insights of how Ml algorithms work.
The hands on sessions include the following concepts:
*** seaborn library ***
*** sentiment analysis insight **
*** logistic regression ***
*** pre-processing ***
*** tf-idf vectorization ***
